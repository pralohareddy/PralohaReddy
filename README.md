## 📂 Projects

### NASA Project: Using APIs to Track the International Space Station (10-05-2024)
-  The tracking of International Space Station (ISS) in real-time using Python. We will use two different APIs to retrieve data on the location and astronauts on board the ISS, and display this information in a graphical representation with a world map.
-  By building this real-time ISS tracker, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the incredible work being done in space, and learn valuable skills for working with APIs and graphical representations in Python.
- There are three parts, starting with displaying the astronauts' names and latitude/longitude, followed by displaying the world map and ISS image, and concluding with tracking the ISS in real-time based on latitude and longitude.
-  At the we  will have a fully functional ISS tracking system that you can continue to expand and customize.
 
### VIRTUAL HQ - Transforming Remote Work into an Immersive Experience (15-04 2025)
-  It is an AI-enabled, metaverse-based platform designed to transform the remote work experience by replicating and enhancing the dynamics of a physical office.
-  Users can navigate customized virtual spaces using personalized avatars and virtual desks, fostering spontaneity and meaningful social interaction.
-  With support for both cloud-based and hybrid deployments, VirtualHQ is scalable, secure, and adaptable to organizations of all sizes.

### Comparative Analysis of Logistic Regression,Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Voting Classifier for Early Stroke Detection (22-04-2025)
- Stroke is a critical global health concern, ranking as the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of long-term disability worldwide.Timely risk prediction plays a pivotal role in minimizing the impact of stroke, enabling proactive medical intervention and significantly improving patient outcomes.
- Through the implementation and comparison of several classification algorithms — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost — and combining them into an ensemble Voting Classifier, the paper shows the power of artificial intelligence to aid in early stroke detection in clinical settings
- Models were trained on the class-balanced dataset that had been carefully preprocessed with SMOTE to combat class imbalance and tested with hard metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

### RETAILWISE - Data driven decisions for hassle-free stock management (27-11-2025)
- Small grocery retailers face challenges in managing perishable inventory and sales due to manual stock tracking in registers or basic spreadsheets, leading to overstocking, stockouts, and wasted produce.
- Without data insights, they struggle to identify fast-moving items, predict seasonal demand, or optimize wholesale orders.
- Algorithms-SMART SEARCH & VOICE ASSISTANT - DISTILBERT FOR SEARCH + WHISPER FOR SPEECH-TO-TEXT. RESTOCK GENIUS - ALTERNATING LEAST SQUARES (ALS) FOR SUGGESTIONS + LIGHTGBM FOR QUANTITY PREDICTION. DYNAMIC PRICING - DEEP Q-NETWORK (DQN) FOR REINFORCEMENT LEARNING / XGBOOST AS A SIMPLER ALTERNATIVE.
